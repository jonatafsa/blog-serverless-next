### Paste images from clipboard

Since Markdown file is only plain text file, users could not insert image data into Markdown file directly, but can insert image reference to file/URL. 

Typora support paste image data from clipboard, **after telling typora where to put those images**. Typora would put image data into given folder or server, then insert images referring to that stored file or URL. Please refer to section **[When insert local image…](#when-insert-local-image…)** for more detail.

> **Tips**: on macOS, users could copy image file from finder and then paste into typora. It has same behavior with drag and drop.
>
> **Tips**: on macOS, you could also copy images from iPhone and then paste into Typora after setup the location to put image files.
